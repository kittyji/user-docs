# Overview Page {#overview}

The **Project Overview page** is a dashboard of a single project, in which the project owner can view and manage inputs, outputs, and monitor the online reconstruction process. In particular, the owner can start / stop reconstruction, upload images, download outputs, report problems and change project settings such as project description and visibility.

## Progress Card {#progress}

### Meaning of different statuses {#meaning}

* **N/A:** You havenâ€™t started the project yet. Please click the **Start **icon on the **Run Task **card to start the reconstruction process.
* **Pending:** Your project is now waiting in a queue. Altizure has received you reconstruction command, but all the machines are running tasks at the moment. So, your project is put in a queue waiting for the reconstruction. The waiting time mainly depends on the number and the size of the projects waiting in front of you.

  **Please notice** that when your project is waiting in a queue, if you stop or restart the project, it will go to the end of the queue, and this will extend your wait time.

* **Not enough images:** There are not enough pictures in your project. Every Altizure project requires at least two images. You can go to **"Run Task &gt; Fully Automatic 3D Reconstruction &gt; Add" **on the Overview page to upload more images, then click **Start **to restart your project.

* **Fail:** The reconstruction of this project is failed. This might be caused by several reasons, e.g. insufficient overlapping photos, underexposure/ overexposure, blurry photos, etc. If you have any questions about the result, please use **Report Problem **on the Overview page to report the problem.

* **Unchanged:** The images of the project are unchanged. So, no need to rerun the project.

* **Done:** The project is finished successfully.

## Settings Card {#settings}

**Name: **You can change the name of your model.

**Description:** You can write a short introduction of your model or anything you like. Other users can see the description when viewing your model.

**Setup Model:** The entrance of the [**Setup Page**](setup-page.md).

**Comments:** For both Free and Pro projects, you can **Allow **or **disallow **the comments on the from other users. If you allow comments, the comments will be shown on the [**3D Model**](model-page.md#light) page.

**Location: **If the input images contain GPS information, your model will be geo-referenced and be displayed on Altizure Earth. For both Free and Pro projects, you can check or uncheck this option.

**Logo:** Professional project users can turn off this function if they don't want to show Altizure logo when presenting the model to other viewers.

**Visibility**: You can set the project as **Public**, **Unlisted **or **Private**. For Free projects, you can only maintain the default setting as **Public**.

* **Public **setting will list your project in our [**Explore**](https://www.altizure.com/) page, meaning that everyone could discover and view your content.

* **Unlisted **setting will not list your project in our site; it can only be accessed by its hyperlink \(URL\). This allows you to share the link of the model to a specific group of audience. However, please note that anyone can view the model as long as they have the link.
In addition, the link to the model should ends with `/model`, i.e. the [**3D Model page**](model-page.md).

* **Private **setting will make your project entirely private and safe. Only the project owner can view the model.

**Transfer:** If you want to transfer the project to another user, you can type in the registration email of the new owner. Please notice that once you transfer the project to the other user, the ONLY thing you can do with the model is to use the function on the [**3D Model page**](model-page.md). You CANNOT do any other operations.
